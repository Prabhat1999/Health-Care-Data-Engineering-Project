# Health-Care-Data-Engineering-Project

Build an end to end data engineering pipeline, where data from different sources are collected in zones and transformation logic are implemented for the data to be analytically ready in the target.

Below is an architecture of the Data Engineering pipeline, of a heath-care data where the Electronic Medical Record(EMR) data is being the source from Azure SQL Database. NPI ,CPT and ICD codes are extracted from the API and stored in the bronze layer in parquet format. 

(NPI: National Provider Identifier

(CPT: Current Procedural Terminology
